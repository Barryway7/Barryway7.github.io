        My work — from robust classification and healthcare analytics to digital twin-based quality prediction — is driven by a single mission: making machine learning more principled and interpretable.

        I am preparing for the next step in my academic journey: a PhD focused on transparent, data-driven methods for complex real-world systems. Please reach out if you'd like to collaborate.
